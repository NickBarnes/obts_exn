# OCaml behind the scenes: exceptions

Sources of the slides and examples of the tech talk given at Tarides, Paris, on 2022/11/18.

Rendered slides are available in the [releases](https://github.com/fabbing/obts_exn/releases/).

This talk is about understanding how OCaml exceptions are implemented in native code.
What happens at the lowest level when an exception is raised and when itâ€™s caught? OCaml exceptions are said to be particularly fast; how is it achieved?
